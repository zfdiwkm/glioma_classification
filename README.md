# glioma_classification

This repository contains the code and relevant files for my Master of Science dissertation project conducted at the University College London. The project focuses on machine learning-based classification of gliomas using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data from the publicly available UCSF-PDGM dataset (https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=119705830).

## Project Overview

Gliomas represent a significant portion of brain tumours and their classification plays a crucial role in developing an effective treatment strategy. MRI scans provide valuable insight into the tumour's characteristics without invasive procedures.

This project uses various image processing and machine learning techniques to classify gliomas based on MRI scans. It involves two primary steps:

Feature Extraction: This step involves processing MRI scans to extract key features that can be used to classify gliomas. 

Machine Learning Based Classification: In this step, extracted features are used to train machine learning models, which are then capable of classifying gliomas.

## Usage

Each script in can be run individually. They contain comments explaining their usage. The general workflow is to first run the feature extraction scripts on the MRI data, and then run the machine learning scripts on the extracted features.

I would like to extend my gratitude to my dissertation supervisors for their support and guidance throughout this project.
